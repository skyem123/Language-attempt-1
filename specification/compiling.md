Compiling
=========

Compiling will be handled by multiple systems, that work together to read in the human readable source code and turn it into something that a computer can execute.

The first stage is to take the source code and split it up into "raw tokens", which are then further processed into tokens that are machine readable.

The processed tokens are then passed onto other systems that can either compile it to be executed later, or interpreted to execute the program.
